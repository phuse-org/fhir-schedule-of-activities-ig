### Background

# Schedule of Activities Project

This IG is intended to provide a roadmap for adopters looking to use FHIR resources in order to support the planning and implementing Clinical Research designs.  This is intended to primarily facilitate high level components.

As it is used commonly, part of the design of this IG will illustrate patterns and examples for reusing design concepts from the [CDISC ODM](cdisc-odm.html).
